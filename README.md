# Unit 6: Housing Rental Analysis for San Francisco

![](6-4-challenge-image.png)

## Background

**Proptech**, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. The company wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. They want to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

I have used Python visualization skills to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.
